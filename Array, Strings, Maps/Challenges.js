// 1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
// 'players2')
const players1 = [...game.players[0]];
// console.log(players1);
const players2 = [...game.players[1]];

// 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
// players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
// goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
// field players
const [gk, ...fieldPlayers] = game.players[0];
// console.log(gk, fieldPlayers);
// 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
// players)
const allPlayers = [...game.players[0], ...game.players[1]];
// console.log(allPlayers);
// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
// new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
// 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
const players1Final = [...game.players[0], "Thiago", "Coutinho", " Peristic"];
// console.log(players1Final);
// 5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
// 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
const { team1, x, team2 } = game.odds;
// console.log(team1, draw, team2);
// 6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
// names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
// number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
function printGoals(...playerNames) {
  playerNames.forEach((element) => {
    //  console.log(element);
  });
  // console.log(playerNames.length);
}
// printGoals(...game.players[0], ...game.players[1])

// team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
// operator.
// console.log(team1<team2? 'team1 going to win':'team2 going to win');

// 1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console,
// along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
for (const [index, element] of game.scored.entries()) {
  // console.log(`Goal ${index+1}: ${element}`);

// studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
let odd = 0,
  avg = 0;
for (const value of Object.values(game.odds)) {
  avg += value;
}
avg /= Object.values(game.odds).length;

// console.log(avg);

// 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
// Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
// Odd of draw: 3.25
//  Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
// Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
// (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
// same property names 😉
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(game.odds)) {
  // console.log(`Odd of Victory ${game[key] ?? "draw"}: ${value}`);
}
// 4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
// players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this
// game, it will look like this:
// {
//   Gnarby: 1,
//   Hummels: 1,
//   Lewandowski: 2
// }

  [47, "⚽ GOAL"],
  [61, "🔁 Substitution"],
  [64, "🔶 Yellow card"],
  [69, "🔴 Red card"],
  [70, "🔁 Substitution"],
  [72, "🔁 Substitution"],
  [76, "⚽ GOAL"],
  [80, "⚽ GOAL"],
  [92, "🔶 Yellow card"],
]);

// 1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no
//   duplicates)
const events = [...new Set(gameEvents.values())];
// console.log(events);
//   2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64
//   was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
gameEvents.delete(64);
// console.log(gameEvents);
//   3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on
//   average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
// console.log(`An event happened, on average, every ${90/[...gameEvents.keys()].length} minutes`);
// console.log(...gameEvents.keys());
//   4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking
//   whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
//   [FIRST HALF] 17: ⚽ GOAL

for (const [key, value] of gameEvents.entries()) {
  // console.log(key< 45? `[FIRST HALF] ${key}: ${value}`: `[SECOND HALF] ${key}: ${value}`);
}

// 1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The
// method does 2 things:
// 1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the
// selected option. The prompt should look like this:
// What is your favourite programming language?
// 0: JavaScript
// 1: Python
// 2: Rust
// 3: C++
// (Write option number)
const poll = {
  question: "What is your favourite programming language?",

      prompt(
        `${this.question}\n${this.options.join("\n")}\n(Write option number)`
      )
    );

    // 1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For
    // example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by
    // 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes
    // sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
    typeof userAnswer === "number" &&
      userAnswer < this.answers.length &&
      this.answers[userAnswer]++;
    this.displayResults();
  },
  // 3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The
  // method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string'
  // or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using
  // console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a
  // string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
  displayResults(type = "array") {
    if (type === "array") {
      console.log(this.answers);
    } else if (type === "string") {
      console.log(`Poll results are ${this.answers.join(", ")}`);
    }
  },
};
// 2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
const registerAnswer = poll.registerNewAnswer.bind(poll);
// document.querySelector(".poll").addEventListener("click", registerAnswer);
// 4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each
// 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

// 5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test
// data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll
// object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation?

// poll.displayResults.call({answers:[5, 2, 3]})

// (function(){
//   const header = document.querySelector('h1');
//   header.style.color = 'red';
//   document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', function(){
//     header.style.color = "blue";
//   })
// })()

///////////////Arrays
// Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
// ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
// 1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have
// cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat
// ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function
// parameters)
// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1
// is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy
// 🐶")
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// § Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
// Hints: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far 😉

// GOOD LUCK 😀

}
// checkDogs(dogsJulia, [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);

// Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
// ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
// 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
// <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
// humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4

  });
  return dogHumanAge;
}

// 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
// keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
dogHumanAge = dogHumanAge.filter((age) => age > 17);
// console.log(dogHumanAge);
// 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
// from other challenges how we calculate averages 😉)
let AvgHumanAgeOfDogs =
  dogHumanAge.reduce(function (acc, cVal) {
    return acc + cVal;
  }, 0) / dogHumanAge.length;
// console.log(AvgHumanAgeOfDogs);
// 4. Run the function for both test datasets
// Test data:
// Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from Challenge #2, but this time
// as an arrow function, and using chaining!
// Test data:
// § Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// § Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

////////////////Challange 4///////////////////////////
// Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are
// eating too much or too little.
// Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the
// recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
// Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10%
// above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
// the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
// not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla:
// recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
// food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
// 2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too
// little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
// the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) 🤓
// 3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
// ('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
// ('ownersEatTooLittle').
// 4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and
// Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat
// too little!"
// 5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
// that is recommended (just true or false)
// 6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
// (just true or false)
// 7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try
// to reuse the condition used in 6.)
// 8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
// portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the
// array's objects 😉)
// Hints:
// § Use many different tools to solve these challenges, you can use the summary
// lecture to choose between them 😉
// § Being within a range 10% above and below the recommended portion means:
// current > (recommended * 0.90) && current < (recommended *
// 1.10). Basically, the current portion should be between 90% and 110% of the
// recommended portion.
// Test data:
